# Generative AI from Scratch

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive 30-day curriculum for implementing deep learning architectures from scratch using only NumPy. The goal is to build a strong understanding of how modern deep learning architectures work under the hood by implementing everything from basic neural networks to advanced architectures like Transformers and Diffusion Models.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Philosophy

The curriculum follows a "learn by implementing" approach. Instead of just using high-level deep learning frameworks, we build everything from the ground up using only NumPy. This approach helps in:

* Understanding the mathematical foundations of deep learning
* Gaining intuition about how different architectures work
* Learning to debug and optimize neural networks effectively
* Building confidence in implementing research papers

Following are the topics covered till date:

Day 1: Linear Regression with Numpy
